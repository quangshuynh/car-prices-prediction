# Used Car Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning application that predicts the price of used cars based on various features such as year, make, model, mileage, and more. The model is built using PyTorch and incorporates a simple neural network for price prediction. The application also includes a Flask web interface that allows users to input car details and get a predicted price.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and scaling of input features.
- **Machine Learning**: A neural network model built with PyTorch to predict car prices.
- **Web Interface**: A Flask-based web application where users can enter car details and receive a price prediction.
- **Model Saving**: The trained model and scaler are saved for future use.
